# Workflow Rules

## Development
- **Always use `.\serve.ps1`** for development — never deploy without explicit user request. Serve mode shows logs directly and saves tokens by shutting down when done.

## Commits
- **Always commit changes** after completing a task.

## Documentation
- **Update AGENTS.md** when discovering important non-obvious patterns.
